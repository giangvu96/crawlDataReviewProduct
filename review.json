{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Looks good, but flawed", "review_body": "We ordered this calculator for our son's birthday. When it arrived, it was immediately clear that the display was broken as the electronic ink was permanently shown on the display at the right hand side. I returned the calculator without opening the package and requested a replacement."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Just what I was looking for.", "review_body": "Why do I need a blue calculator??? Well, other than the fact that I just like to be different, I am seriously tired of my co-workers walking off with my calculator. The plain grey calculators all look alike. This is a big enough calculator that people can't easily hide or deny if I walk up and I can see it...And I can see it from a ways away. There is no denying that this is my calculator."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Poor quality - only the bottom half of numbers show up!", "review_body": "Bought 12 of these for my special education classroom. They get used about 30 minutes per day total and I have had them about 2 months now. They worked fine at first, now only the bottom half of numbers show up on the screen - so they are totally unusable. The design is nice, large buttons easily manipulated by children and with large visuals to go by. But the quality just isn't there. I would not recommend."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "OK, but battery is NOT replaceable", "review_body": "Arrived quickly. Good design, simple and uncluttered for basic tasks with large well marked keys. Since it is also battery powered I was a bit disappointed that the screen wasn't backlit. I needed a battery operated calculator as I often need to use one in fairly low light situations and the solar powered one I have was a pain.  Then looked in the instructions for the battery type that it used, and found out that the battery is NOT replaceable. When the battery dies, you have a solar calculator only. That should have been in the description of the item."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Not quite a 10-key calculator", "review_body": "The color is true to the product pic, and the keys work so far (they're a hard plastic), but the positioning of the keys aren't intuitive, if you're accustomed to standard 10-key calculators. Keys 1-9 and the arithmetic operations are fine - these are in a standard location, but who puts the \"ON\" button on the side middle? I'm constantly pressing the \"CE\" button instead, which won't turn on the calculator. I'm also used to having the \"+/-\" , 0, and \".\" in other placements, but these are minor in comparison to the power button positioning. Basically, the layout forces you to look and find what you need, rather than typing away."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Buy a Texas Instuments calculator instead", "review_body": "I've used lots of calculators throughout my life and I've got to say that this calculator is by far the worst calculator I have ever used!!!  Two main reasons: 1.  the calculator doesn't calculate percentage like other calculators.  Meaning on a regular calculator if you input a number and push the percent sign the calculator would convert that number to a decimal.  And if you used the percent to calculate the percentage of tax for example the calculator would usually give you the percentage amount then the total.  2.  There is no OFF button.  It takes 10-12 minutes to automatically shut off.  I know its dual powered but its such a waste of power and I like to make sure I shut my things off."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Horrible, cheap junk!", "review_body": "Cheap junk!  I chose this calculator because I really liked the color & overall look. I just needed a basic 10-key style calculator.  The size is fine, but the buttons are horrible!  It's so frustrating to use that I finally threw it away, and I really hate to waste things like that!  Even when you're trying to hit the keys carefully (as opposed to quickly by touch), it's still really hard to get the keys to work consistently.  They stick a lot or just don't make contact.  It's also very light and slides easily while you try use it.  You need one hand to hold it and one to type (and re-type and clear and re-type again)."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "neat colors, but quality not equal to Sharp, Casio, or Canon", "review_body": "I bought this Avalon calculator for its large size, its shape (I like that the display is angled upward a little), and for the selection of fun colors. I chose green. It's solar-powered but also comes with a battery for use in darker environments. Love the jumbo display, buttons, and the huge 'equals' button - the one button you use all the time."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Functions but very cheap", "review_body": "This pink calculator is cute and functions ok, but it's slightly frustrating to use because you have to push so hard on the buttons to make them work. I've messed up my calculations many times because I'm going too fast and realize that a number didn't register. You have to push really hard and go slow. It's ok for simple calculations and is easier than getting my iPhone calculator out each time but it's very low quality. You get what you pay for."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Definitely Does the Job", "review_body": "I bought this calculator after I spilled coffee over the one I always have on my home office desk.  I needed a basic calculator - no fancy bells or whistles, just reliable, easy to read calculations.  I've been using it daily for over a week and find nothing to complain about:  operates on dual power (solar/battery) so is bright and clear even when stored in a drawer for a while; easy to read display,  large number/function keys that are easy to locate and read, very reasonable price,  - the cute color doesn't hurt either."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Cute basic calculator", "review_body": "My original receipt arrived not working correctly.  The screen didn't fully display all the digits.  The vendor replaced the item quickly.  Nice to do business with a vendor that stands by its products.  I purchased this for my 6 year old who is interested in math.  Since green is his favorite color, I thought this would be a hit.  The buttons and display are large. Which makes it easy to use for a beginner.  Basic calculator that meets my son's basic needs. It's not heavy and the rubber feet keep the calculator from sliding around."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Cute and Colorful!", "review_body": "When I had to replace my calculator, I was looking for something colorful for my desk at work and this little calculator caught my eye. I love the big numbers and function keys. They're easy to see and it's small in size so doesn't take up a huge space on my desk. One thing that bothers me is the overhead flourescent lighting makes the display difficult to see as there's a reflection problem, but it seems to be the same with whatever calculator I've used so that's not a problem as I just angle it so the lights don't shine directly on the display. The battery is not replaceable but since it's also solar powered, that's not a huge problem, but it really should have been addressed in the original product description. I love this colorful little calculator that adds a touch of pizzaz to my desk."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Returned.", "review_body": "The calculator that I received was defective.  The Error code was present from the beginning and would not clear.  The unit would not perform any calculations other than addition.  Thinking that it just needed more power, I then tried to let it get some solar power for a day or so--but that failed to resolve the issue."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Display malfunctioned after less than a year of use", "review_body": "Worked well for a while, but after several months the display began to malfunction, showing malformed numbers (segments gray or unlit instead of black). Maybe the battery needs replacement, but in bright light the \"solar\" panel should provide enough power even with no battery power; mine doesn't. Otherwise, no complaints, except maybe that it is very lightweight and doesn't always stay put in use."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Not Recommended for One-Handed Office/School Work", "review_body": "As for functionality, calculations work as they should, however it has a few quirks that make it unsuitable for my needs."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Calculator wobbles/flips up when you tap the + sign", "review_body": "The calculator works fine but the rubber feet on back that keep it in place do not do their job. The + button is SO far over to the side, when you punch in the + the whole calculator wobbles/flips up even with a normal tap. It's the most annoying thing, I can't even use it for one garage sale I bought it for. It's a shame because otherwise it's fine. Definite return."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "I liked how big the screen was and the size of ...", "review_body": "The screen on the first one that I bought cracked so badly that I couldn't use it. I liked how big the screen was and the size of the buttons, so I purchased the same calculator a second time. This one does not have a cracked screen, but it does not work :( I have to press down really, really hard on the buttons, and it does not compute. I liked the look of this calculator, but I ended up getting a Casio standard function calculator. My grade depends somewhat on the functioning of the calculator. The one I received is not working."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Probably my most used and favorite calculator.", "review_body": "Probably my most used and favorite calculator.  Large Digit Display and Bright too, some other calculators are not bright enough especially with solar powered.  Buttons are also bigger to maximize the space.  And, the 8 digit display gives you more calculating power.  Highly Recommended!!"},

I teach special needs kids who need the big buttons.  Well, one of the six did not work at all and another only sort of works (the \"CE\" button doesn't work).  So, if you're willing to pay for six and get four, this is the deal for you.  Apparently, quality control is not a hallmark of Avalon."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "All the features I want and none of the features I don't want!", "review_body": "Love this! Perfect for my 12 year old who needed a calculator for math work, but without all the distracting bells and whistles. Big easy to see buttons and numbers on the screen. The big plus is that this works off of a battery when the solar panel is not working when you are working in lower light. When it arrived the screen was damaged and they quickly sent out a replacement."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "These worked great for my students", "review_body": "These worked great for my students.  They are super simple with only the functions needed for elementary school (1-6) math. The big buttons are great for little hands and for students who have difficulty with fine motor skills (OT issues).  My students especially liked them because of the bright color, saying they \"look like they're fun to use!\"  The visual was highly motivating.  Students always choose to use these over the regular black/grey/silver ones I already had.  I would definitely buy these again."},

{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Not Dependable in a Time Crunch!", "review_body": "This calculator sometimes shows a \"0\" after typing in several numbers and an action (multiply, divide, etc).  The numbers will come up as I type them but somewhere in the process, it is being erased from memory.  Maybe I'm hitting the keys too quickly, too much pressure, not enough pressure - I don't know why.  After using this thing for about 15 minutes I have tossed the two I purchased in the trash.  Sometimes it works fine and other times it doesn't.  I ordered two of these to use when taking a timed test for my real estate license and I absolutely cannot afford the inconvenience of having to re-input calculations.  I give it 2 stars because it should be fine if you have the time and patience to deal with the issue I described."},

The only problem I have is it was shipped with no fillers inside the box so the calculator was bouncing around and came out of its original packaging.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Nice Calculator...", "review_body": "Haven't had time to make a whole lot of use of this item yet, but here is my initial quick and dirty --- good product...  display is good and dark, easy to read.  Calculator is large enough to sit still when being used, but small enough to tuck away nicely when not in use. Buttons are reasonably large and easy to use without fat-fingering.  My only negative is the battery is not replaceable.  I know, it is solar powered, but that assumes you will always be working in a fairly well lit environment... Not always the case."},

Since the package itself was not damaged in any way, it must have been packaged with the scratch while still at the factory.  The calculator appears to work, so 2 stars for that.

The design is well thought out and it has the look, feel and function of a high quality calculator. The display is super easy to read and the keys are large, well laid out, and work very smoothly.  Kudos to Avalon Electronics for putting the effort into designing a product that was actually made to last in what has become a throw away society.I highly recommend this product.  If fact, I plan to order a second one!"},

The only thing I don't care for is that there is no off button and that instructions say it will go off automatically after 11 minutes.

I've had calculators in the past where you have to make sure to hit certain number keys exactly the right way and this calculator is not like that!

This is  the best calculator that I have found (and I have tried many) for my application... in the cabs of my fleet of over 70 trucks in the plumbing & heating and fuel delivery business. The large buttons, large displays, dual power are what my guys like about these Avalon calculators. I like that I have found something that stands up in daily use. I also like the dual power and the bright colors.  The only Avalon calculators that have failed on the job were due to being crushed or smashed.

The only issue I have is that the edges are kind of rounded so if you push the buttons on the side too hard (for instance the plus sign) it tips easily.  It doesn't tip over, just to the side you are pushing (like a see-saw.) The calculator this replaced was squarer and didn't tip."},

The number keys are pretty big, so no worries about pushing the wrong button. I have used this for a few days now, and it works absolutely fine. It also comes in several different colors, including black. I got the purple, which I happen to love. It has a slightly tilted display, so it is very easy to read. This calculator from Avalon would be perfect for home or office. I use mine at home to balance my checkbook. Works great! **I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed are my own.**"},
